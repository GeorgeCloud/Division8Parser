# Fresco Coding Challenge: Hardware Sets

## **Objective**

Build a system that extracts **Hardware Sets** from construction specification documents. Your input is a set of pages from a Division 08 (Openings) specbook. Your goal is to extract every hardware set into a structured format, including **where on the page** each set is located.

## **Background**

A **hardware set** is a named group of door hardware components (hinges, locksets, closers, etc.) assigned to doors in a building. They appear in specbooks as either:

- **Section/list format:** A header (e.g., "SET #1 — ENTRANCE DOORS") followed by an indented list of components.
- **Table format:** A tabular schedule where rows are components grouped under set headers.

A typical project has 5–30 hardware sets, each with 3–15 components.

## **Materials**

Here are ~30 specbooks with hardware sets

## **Expected Output**

For each hardware set, output:

- set_number — e.g., "1", "3A", "15"
- description — optional heading, e.g., "ENTRANCE DOORS"
- location — where the set lives: page number and bounding box or line range
- components[] — each with: qty, description, catalog_number, mfr, finish, notes

## **Caveats**

**Manufacturer codes vs. finish codes**

Short codes are used for both manufacturers and finishes, and some are **ambiguous**. For example, **"PE"** can mean Pemko (manufacturer) or Painted Enamel (finish). **"NO"** can mean Norton or the word "No." The correct interpretation depends on context — a column mostly containing MK, LCN, SCH is a manufacturer column; one with US26D, 630, BSP is a finish column. Your system should resolve ambiguity from surrounding context, not individual values.

**Other difficulties**

- **Set boundaries** aren't always obvious — sometimes just a blank row or subtle set number change.
- **"NOT USED" sets** (marked N/A, NOT USED, etc.) should still be extracted.
- **Multi-page sets** — a single set may span page breaks.
- **Inconsistent column layouts** — different specbooks use different schemas.
- **Missing quantities** — output null rather than guessing.

## **Guidelines**

- **Tools:** Any languages, libraries, and AI tools. Python recommended.
- **Evaluation criteria:** Extraction accuracy, handling of caveats above (especially mfr vs. finish), code quality, and clarity of explanation.

## **What to submit**

- **Repository** with a clear README (setup + run instructions).
- **Deployment** — a deployed link or clear local run steps.
- **Demo video** (~3–5 min Loom): walk through your approach, tradeoffs, and show it working on 2–3 different spec pages.

## **Success criteria**

- Finds all of the hardware sets in the specbook.
- Correctly extracts ~90%+ of hardware sets and their components.
- Accurately maps fields to the right columns (especially mfr vs. finish).
- Provides meaningful location data for each set.
- Works across different specbook formats.

## **Bonus points**

- **Feedback UI** for correcting extraction mistakes.
- **Confidence scores** on extracted fields.
- **Spec/catalog code resolution** — resolving shorthand codes (e.g., code "A" → full component details) using a lookup table on the same page.
